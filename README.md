## GROUP 3 ADVANCED LAB SPRING 2025
### OVERVIEW
The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide us with one space for all our data analysis and plots. While we don't necessarily have to do any programming for this class, the labs we complete in Advanced Lab are made simpler by knowing how to sort, plot, and fit data to better understand how our results match expected outcomes. This not only allows us to learn more in depth the theories we're testing, it also provides us with good practice for data analysis in our careers as experimental physicists. These projects can serve as a tool for future coding and data-analysis ideas, as well as a hub for our past work.

### HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY
For each lab, there is a folder containing data, scripts (for analyzing the data), and plots (of the data). Usage of the scripts varies, as each of us has a different "dialect" when coding. Most of the scripts are in Python, but some are in C++.

If you want to access this code, simply clone this repository or do `git pull` if you already have it available.
